# Coding Challenges
This repository contains a series of coding challenges that we will use to sharpen, hone, foster, develop, improve, and polish our problem solving skills. 

Please feel free to code in the language of your choice. Or, if you're feeling particularly tricksy, try doing these problems in both javascript and ruby. If you do this, pay particular attention to the differences and note which language you find yourself more at ease in. This will most likely be the language you will prefer to conduct technical interviews in.
